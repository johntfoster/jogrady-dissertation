\subsection{Straight Beam Results}
The simplest test case for this model is a linear-elastic beam with a square profile.
These models represent beams that are 1cm thick and 1cm wide, with a bulk modulus $k = 37.5$GPa and Poisson's ratio $\nu = \sfrac{1}{3}$.
Each is loaded transversely with a load of 0.0833N, except for \cref{fig:moment_n}, which shows a beam loaded with a moment of 0.0833N$\cdot$m.
In beams simulating inelastic behavior, the critical strain of the material is set to $\varepsilon_c = 0.001$.
The elastic cases are compared to analytical solutions of the Euler beam equation with appropriate boundary conditions.
Even a coarse discretization successfully reproduces the shape of the elastically deformed, simply-supported beam shown  in \cref{fig:elastic_g2000} deformed under uniform load.

It is more difficult to accurately reproduce the behavior of a clamped-end beam.
It is evident from \cref{fig:clamped_n,fig:clamped_h} that the clamped end constraint requires far more nodes and a smaller horizon to reproduce the results of a classical elastic model.
\Cref{fig:cantilever_n} shows a cantilever beam with one clamped end and one free end, deflecting under a uniformly distributed load.

As an elastic-perfectly-plastic beam exceeds the elastic limit of its material, plastic zones begin to grow on the top and bottom of the beam's cross section.
This behavior is mimicked by the plasticity of the longest bond-pairs described in \cref{eq:epp_force}, producing the results shown in \cref{fig:eppu_h10_g2000}.
To evaluate plastic beam behavior, plastic beam models with identical material properties are created and analyzed in Abaqus 6.12 to verify simple cases.
To accurately capture this phenomenon and model beam plasticity, a finer discretization is required.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \resizebox{0.6\linewidth}{!}{\input{\plotpath/eppu_h10_g2000.pgf}}
  \caption{The elastic perfectly-plastic beam requires finer discretization}
  \label{fig:eppu_h10_g2000}
\end{figure}

A material that is plastically deformed does not return to its original state when unloaded.
For a beam in bending, the residual deformations can be seen in a beam that has been loaded beyond the onset of plastic deformation and then unloaded.
The Abaqus model retains slightly more than \sfrac{1}{10} of its loaded displacement after being completely unloaded.
This result is observed in the bond-pair plasticity model, shown in \cref{fig:ResidualPlasticityN,fig:ResidualPlasticityH}. 
Accurate residual deformation modeling requires both a relatively small horizon and a fairly large number of nodes.
While this makes for a computationally expensive model in this case, it allows for implementation of more complex plasticity models without additional expense; a plasticity model that includes softening is no more effort to implement, and would result in damage fields that depend on the peridynamic horizon, not on the density of the discretization.
Because the peridynamic horizon is ideally a material property, this has the effect of regularizing the solution.
Implementing a strain-softening plasticity model in a finite element beam would, by contrast, result in the localization of plasticity into one element and depend strongly on the choice of discretization.

\end{figure}

It is more difficult to verify the brittle material model described by \cref{eq:brittle_force} because brittle failure is unstable.
When a crack begins, moment is transferred to other bond pairs, and failure progresses until every pair of bonds surrounding a node are broken, creating a hinge at that node.
This is borne out by the results in \cref{fig:brittleBeam}, in which ``Nodal Health'' represents the fraction of bond-pairs about each node that have never exceeded their critical angle and therefore have not failed.

  \caption{A brittle beam with prescribed center displacement}
  \label{fig:brittleBeam}
\end{figure}

Unlike a local model, partial failure is observed at nodes near the plastic hinge, as pairs of bonds that straddle the hinge are broken.
This is an important feature of peridynamics; as in the plastic beam, the damaged region of the brittle beam depends on the peridynamic horizon rather than on the density of the discretization.
In a finite element model, damage will occur between elements or within a single element.
Either way, mesh refinement will eventually result in damage localization to an infinitely small damage region.

\subsection{Flat Plate Results}

The simplest test case for the 2D model is a linear-elastic 1m by 1m plate that is simply-supported on all 4 sides with a uniform transverse pressure load on the entire surface between the supports.  
The plates in this section have a shear modulus $k=37.5$Gpa, and unless otherwise noted, a Poisson's ratio of \(\nu = \sfrac{1}{3}\).
The elastic plates are all loaded with a total transverse force of $937.5$N.
As expected from an energy-equivalent model, the slice along the plate's centerline shown in \cref{fig:plate_convergence_h} demonstrates good agreement between the static deflection predicted by the bond-pair model and that of classical linear elasticity as the horizon length shrinks.  
This convergence only continues to a minimum horizon, below which the discretized equation of motion (\cref{eq:discretebeamEoM}) ceases to accurately approximate the continuous integral formulation (\cref{eq:PDstateEoM,eq:SillingForceNO}).  
The minimum horizon size depends on the discretization; it appears that three times the node spacing is sufficient, but that a horizon that is only twice the node spacing is insufficient.  
The difference is evident in \cref{fig:plate_minimum_h}, which also shows that results are insensitive to fineness of discretization once the minimum horizon criterion is met.

Accurate results require a denser discretization than is the case for the elastic beams from previous work.  \Cref{fig:plate_convergence_n} illustrates the model converging to the analytical solution as the discretization is made finer and the horizon shrinks.

\end{figure}

The test case for the hybrid model is a similar simply-supported square plate with an additional in-plane tension load along two opposing sides.  An analytical solution for this combination of uniform transverse pressure and in-plane edge tension can be found in Timoshenko's book~\cite{timoshenko1959theory}.  As is mechanically intuitive, increasing in-plane tension results in decreasing transverse displacement, while the opposite is true for compressive edge loading.  Normalized to the the maximum displacement of a transversely-loaded plate with no in-plane edge loads, the results in \cref{fig:plateStiffening} show that the hybrid model does a good job of simulating the impact of in-plane tension on maximum transverse deflection.

%
The bond-multiple plate model is motivated by the desire to extend the bending model to an arbitrary Poisson's ratio, so the obvious test for this model is the same as for the bond-pair model. When compared to analytical predictions, \cref{fig:plate_poisson} demonstrates the bond-multiple model's ability to simulate plates with Poisson's ratios that depart significantly from the bond-pair limitation of $\nu = \sfrac{1}{3}$.

Unlike the brittle beam, failure in a brittle plate need not progress unstably. 
To demonstrate the behavior of this model, a controlled-displacement double-torsion fracture test was simulated with the bond-pair model using a critical strain $\varepsilon_c = 0.001$. 
A good review of the double-torsion test is available in \cite{shyam2006double}. 
\Cref{fig:DTsetup} shows the setup of a double torsion fracture test. 
This test is particularly useful because it results in a bending crack whose growth is not unstable.
The two sides of the cracked plate act as torsion springs; as the crack grows longer, the torsion springs grow longer as well, and correspondingly softer.
The overall result is that, even though the plate's resistance to bending decreases as the crack grows, growth is stable until the crack nears the far side of the plate. 
The simple qualitative results are shown in \cref{fig:DTdamage}, colored by the fraction of failed bond pairs around each node. 
For each successive displacement load, the stable progression of the damaged region extends further into the plate. 
The relationship between load displacement and crack length is consistent with a plane-stress mode I fracture toughness around 17GPa$\sqrt{\textrm{m}}$.
As with the brittle beam, the region within one horizon of the crack shows partial damage.

\end{figure}
%
In the double-torsion plate, the crack is expected to progress straight across the plate.
A more interesting failure pattern can be found if the displacement is applied to only one of the two sides of the pre-crack.
In a ``single torsion'' cracked plate, the crack path is expected to curve, and this result can be seen in \cref{fig:SingleTorsion}.

\subsection{Irregular Discretization Results}
While it is simple to discretize the shapes examined thus far so that bonds pair up nicely, that is tougher to do for most shapes we are interested in analyzing.
To combine the analytical simplicity of the previous shapes with a demonstration of the ability to handle irregular shapes, we discretize simple shapes in an irregular fashion.
The first is a return to the simply-supported beam under uniform load.
\Cref{fig:BeamIrreg} shows that the irregularly-discretized beam has the same deflection under uniform load as the regular discretization.

An example of a regularly-discretized plate is shown in \cref{fig:regularmesh}, while an irregularly discretized plate is shown in \cref{fig:unevenmesh}.
To use this plate in a peridynamic simulation, we reduce each element to a single node at the element's centroid with volume equal to the volume of the element.

\subsection{Curved Surface Results}
To test the virtual point method for curved surfaces, we start with the simple case illustrated in \cref{fig:ProvingRing} of a ring in bending with a beam cross section.
Like the straight beam, the curved beam is 0.01m in both width and thickness, with shear modulus $k=37.5$Gpa and Poisson's ratio $\nu = \sfrac{1}{3}$.
This 1m-diameter ring is subjected to a point load of 0.0833N.
A real-life example of this type of problem would be a proving ring used for force measurements.

  \input{\diagrampath/ProvingRing.tex}
  \caption{Proving Ring Setup}
  \label{fig:ProvingRing}
\end{figure}
%
The plots in \cref{fig:beamRing_n,fig:beamRing_h} show that convergence to the classical elastic solution is more a function of the shrinking horizon size than of denser discretization, though the discretization must be dense enough to allow sufficient nodes in each neighborhood.

%

Similarly, the use of virtual points in the simulation of curved plates and shells can be examined by starting with the ring model depicted in \cref{fig:PlateRing}.
This ring is 1m in diameter, 0.01m thick, and 0.25m wide.
The ring is loaded in the same manner as the beam-based ring, but with a line load with total magnitude 937.5N.
In cross-section, the ring looks like \cref{fig:ProvingRing}.

\Cref{fig:PlateRing_n} demonstrates that, as with the curved beam, the curved shell requires a dense discretization to model.
This is mostly as a consequence of requiring a small horizon.
Surfaces with less curvature are less constrained.
